This directory contains image fragments used to patch tiles.

When the GIMP Python scripts are used to rotate and scale a
tile, the resulting tile sometimes has values and other text
that has become too small to read and is now at an angle.

The fragments in this directory are mostly value circles that
can be used to replace the unreadable ones on the scaled tiles.

These fragments are all based on circle.png. The numbers are
font size 12 Sans Bold. They can be placed over the existing
value circles or the existing circles can be over written by 
the background color and then they can be placed anywhere on 
the tile. 

Tile numbers can be rewritten using font size 10 Sans.

Other text on the tile can be scaled as appropriate.
